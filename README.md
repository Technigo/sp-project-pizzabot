## Project

The project task was build a simple Pizzabot to learn some of the basics of JavaScript mainly focusing on alerts and prompts. By adding different steps in the ordering process I needed to get input from the user (e.g. name) and also display new choices based on previous choices (e.g. different pizza types when pizza is chosen). 
There are two .js files "script.js" and "switch.js". In the first one I used if/else conditionals in the second I tried my hand and switch-case structure.
