# Pizzabot

This project demonstrates basic JavaScript competency using an interactive Pizzabot who takes a customer's order. The customer goes through a series of prompts, starting with entering their name. The Pizzabot then greets the customer and proceeds to take a food order. The customer can choose from pizza, pasta, or salad. Based on the selection, they are given three subtypes to choose from. The Pizzabot then asks for the customer's age to determine if the price and portion of the meal will be for an adult or a child. Finally, the customer is given the option to confirm or cancel the order.

I went through each of the prompts and listed the options in advance so I could map out how to write the code. At each selection stage, I included a while loop that uses a boolean value to repeatedly prompt the user for valid input if it is anything other than the given options. I also wrote an alternative JavaScript file that uses switch statements in place of some of the conditional statements I used in the original code.

This project currently incorporates only a single order, but in the future I would like to implement a full menu and allow the customer to order multiple items and choose specific toppings for their pizza. I would also like to improve the visual appeal and add more interactive elements.
