## Project

The project task was build a simple Pizzabot to learn some of the basics of JavaScript mainly focusing on alerts and prompts. By adding different steps in the ordering process I needed to get input from the user (e.g. name) and also display new choices based on previous choices (e.g. different pizza types when pizza is chosen).
